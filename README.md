# DataCollectionWebsite_PersianChatbot
This is a Persian chatting website designed to collect data through gamification. In order to collect data for a personal information extraction chatbot, we needed chit-chat dialogues which contain personal info such as name, age, gender, occupation, etc. interlocutors should gently acquire this info through the course of the dialogues and they should avoid asking so many direct questions which may turn the conversation into an interrogation. The chatting website has been tailored to cover these features and participants are encouraged to take part into data collection by playing a game. The purpose of this game is guessing most correct personal info about each interlocutor while intriguing them to give info on their own.
